print("\n-----WELCOME TO THIS CRICKET GAME-----\n THIS GAME IS MADE BY KHUSHBU JAIN WHILE STUDYING IN CLASS 12th (2023-24).\n:::INSTRUCTIONS:::\n1. You have to select any random number from 0 to 6. \n2. The computer will also select a number. \n3. While batting, if the number selected by you and computer is different, then your number will add to your runs.\nIf the number selected by you and computer is same, then you will lose your wicket. \n4. While bowling, if the number selected by you and computer is different, then the computer's number will add to its runs.\nIf the number selected by you and computer is same, then the computer will lose its wicket. \n5. Each player will get 2 wickets and 2 overs (12 bowls) for batting and bowling. \n6. The innings will end after either the three wickets fell or the overs end. \n7. The player with maximum runs wins.\n8. MAGICAL STEP : When you have selected 0 then computer run will be to assigned to you and adds to your runs.")
